# Appointment-and-Attendance-System-with-Geo-Location
It is a php based attendance and appointment management system which uses geo fencing to check whether user is in designated location or not. 

Step1- User logins to their account or can even register.

Step2- User can book an appointment and wait for the confirmation.

Step3- Admin can approve the appointment request using the admin panel which requires admin id and password.

Step4- Once admin accepts the request, a confirmation message is displayed to the user and a ticket is generated. 

Step5- User has to be physically present at the location in order to get entry and attendance can also be marked once the user's location is verified using              geofencing. 


Future Scope- Adding face recognition so that two factor authentication can be enabled.
